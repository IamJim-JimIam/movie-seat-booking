this has nothing to do with a readme, it's really notes for
myself that I can hopefully use to replicate the form of what's being done here.

- Javascript :

* pick dom elements to fuck with
* use document. notation to fuck with them
* lather, rinse, repeat
* example:
  const container = document.querySelector('.container');
  this gives js access to the container on the document model. The .querySelector on the container allows querying the container and the ability to manipulate it to the hearts content.

- .querySelectorAll('.seat');
  In the above case this allows js to access all classes of the seat variable (I want to call it an object, but not sure if that would be correct)
